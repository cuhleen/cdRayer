Stuff to add, in no particular order:
- In-app menu(s) to control variables such as speed, acceleration, size, so on
- Automatically generate cdClear and cdBlur textures from any image
- Sync with Spotify API, get album cover from there or somewhere else
- CD player skins
- Remake it? My vision was to have an app with no taskbar icon, that can draw anything anywhere on the screen but allows clicks through it *but* still has a small button always present somewhere that opens up more menus, all while being lightweight of course.
