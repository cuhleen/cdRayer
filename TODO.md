Stuff to add, in no particular order:
- In-app menu(s) to control variables such as speed, acceleration, size, so on
- CD player skins
- Remake it? My vision was to have an app with no taskbar icon, that can draw anything anywhere on the screen but allows clicks through it *but* still has a small button always present somewhere that opens up more menus, all while being lightweight of course.

#### *KEEP IN MIND*
I mostly made this app for myself, I don't necessarily plan on fine tuning it to work perfectly on other systems, not for now at least.
