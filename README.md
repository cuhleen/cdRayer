- Step 2: Open the app folder, *"assets"*, from there open *"cdCover.png"* or *"cdCoverFast.png"*
- Step 3: Add a layer on top. Place your album cover so it is scaled with the window. Then clip
- Step 4: Export as *"cdCover.png"* inside "assets" in the app folder
- Step 5: Apply radial blur to your photo. Repeat steps 3 and 4, but export as *"cdCoverFast.png"*
- You should be done!
